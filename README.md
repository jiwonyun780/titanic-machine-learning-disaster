    Ensures reproducibility by fixing the randomness in processes.

## Quantitative Analysis

### **Evaluation Metrics**
- **ROC AUC**: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### **Performance Metrics Table**
| Data Split   | ROC AUC  |
|--------------|----------|
| Training     | 85.0     |
| Validation   | 88.0     |

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Negative Impacts
- **Math or Software Problems**:
  - Bias in training data (e.g., imbalanced classes) can lead to poor generalization.
  - Missing or imputed values might introduce inaccuracies in predictions.
- **Real-World Risks**:
  - Misclassification could lead to incorrect decisions in critical scenarios.
  - Discrimination against underrepresented groups in the dataset.

### Potential Uncertainties
- **Math or Software Problems**:
  - Uncertainty in the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data, especially given class imbalance.
  - Overfitting to training data due to dataset-specific patterns.
- **Real-World Risks**:
  - The model might not generalize well across different populations or settings.
  - Ethical implications may arise when predictions affect human lives or rights.

### Unexpected Results
- The test set containing only one class highlighted the need for balanced datasets.
- This unexpected outcome underscores the importance of careful dataset preparation before training and evaluation.
